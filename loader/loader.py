#PURPOSE: The loader installs any requirements deemed necessary by the team,
#as well as compiles the .py and .c files provided by the user. The .pyc and
#binaries are then sent to the launcher, which executes them.

#NOTE: the name of the .txt is the install env to be used.
#For example, if you needed pwntools, you would simply
#put 'pwntools' on it's own line in pip.txt.
#The 'env' parameter specifies which install environment
